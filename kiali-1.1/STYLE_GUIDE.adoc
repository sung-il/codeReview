== Backend - Go

The backend is written in link:https://golang.org/[Go]. If you are not familiar with it, you can take link:https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1[a Tour of Go].

In Kiali we use link:https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/[gofmt] as part of our build process to keep a consistent formatting.

While we haven't automated static code analysers, it is still a good idea to check that new pieces of code are correct with tools such as link:https://github.com/golang/lint[golint] or link:https://golang.org/cmd/vet/[govet].

=== Imports

If you need any library you should import them in the following format

----
<standard imports>
LINE
<third party imports>
LINE
<kiali imports>
----

Example:

[source,go]
----
import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"

	"github.com/kiali/kiali/log"
)
----

== Frontend - TypeScript
