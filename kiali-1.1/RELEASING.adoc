= Releasing Kiali

Kiali is released weekly on Fridays: a minor release every three weeks,
and snapshots on the other weeks. A Jenkins instance is used to
automate the releases.

If you need to make an extraordinary release, please ask
to a member of the QE team to trigger the release for you.
Alternatively, ask the QE team for access to the Jenkins instance
and trigger the release by yourself.

If you don't have access to Jenkins, or want to test the release locally,
<<run-locally,you can run it on your machine>>.

Currently, the Pipeline supports _major_, _minor_, _snapshot (end-of-week)_
and patch releases. _Minor_ and _snapshot_ releases will release the
back-end and the front-end together. _Patch_ releases have the
option to omit releasing the UI and, instead, use the latest UI in
the final package.

Edge-snapshots (or snapshots after merged PRs) are also handled in the Pipeline.

== Finished product

When the release process is complete, a new DockerHub image will be available in the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/kiali/kiali/tags/[Kiali Docker Hub repo].

== Actions before creating a release

These actions are not performed by the release process. Please, do
these actions manually before running the release process.

=== Creating a new JIRA issue

If you know that you'll spend a considerable amount of time doing
the release, create a new issue on
link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI[JIRA] detailing the
release, and add sub-tasks if necessary.

=== Updating Docs

Make sure that the https://www.kiali.io/gettingstarted/[_Getting Started_ document]
of the website is up to date and works with the new version.

The doc sources are in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali.io[kiali/kiali.io repository].
Update the document, and create a PR.

== Actions after creating a release

These actions are not performed by the release process. Please, do
these actions manually after the release process finishes successfully.

=== Updating JIRA issues

Edit all issues in `Awaiting Release` state with `Fix-Version`:

* Use this query https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?filter=12336798
* Use Tools>Bulk Change>All XX issue(s)
* Select all issues and press `Next`
* `Edit issues`
* `Change Fix Version/s`>`Add to existing`>Pick the version to release>Unselect `Send mail for this update`>Next>Confirm

Transition all issues to `Released`:

* Use this query https://issues.jboss.org/issues/?filter=12337486
* Use Tools>Bulk Change>All XX issue(s)
* Select all issues and press `Next`
* `Transition issues`
* `Released`>Next
* Unselect `Send mail for this update`>Next>Confirm

After that, close the release issues, and then, create a new `Release` in JIRA
for the next release.

Mark the current version as released, and create a new minor version:
https://issues.jboss.org/projects/KIALI?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page

=== Notify Istio and Openshift Istio Teams for changes

There are no fixed steps for releasing a new version on the Istio installer,
each release is kind of different.

This has been done a few times before, so they can be used as references:

* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/5869
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/5921
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/6192
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/6592
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/6594
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/7042
* https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/7007

Those PRs cover both the ansible-installer and the helm installer updates.

=== Send out notifications

Finally, we just need to send the notifications to create awareness of the new
release.

Post an email about the release on our
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/kiali-dev[Mailing List].

Send a message on our channel at Freenode, #kiali.

Post a message on our twitter,
link:https://www.twitter.com/KialiProject[@KialiProject]. If you don't know
who's responsible for the account, ask on IRC.

== Release process of the Jenkins Pipeline

The Pipeline uses the Jenkinsfile located at
link:deploy/jenkins-ci/Jenkinsfile[deploy/jenkins-ci/Jenkinsfile]
in the https://github.com/kiali/kiali/[kiali/kiali] repository.

The Pipeline performs the following actions to do the release:

* Checkouts the code of, both, the back-end and the front-end
* Builds the back-end and the front-end
* Run tests for back-end and front-end
* If all tests pass:
** The front-end is released to NPM
** A docker image integrating the back-end and the front-end is built
   and pushed to DockerHub
** Tags for the new releases are created
** If a _minor_ release was done, _master_ branches are prepared for the
    next version and a version branches named of the form _vX.Y_ are created
** If a _patch_ release was done, _vX.Y_ branches are prepared for the next version
** If a _major_ release was done, versions in _vX.Y_ branches are promoted
    (-snapshot suffix is removed)

== [[run-locally]]Running the release process locally

If you don't have access to the Jenkins instance or the release process
through Jenkins doesn't suit your needs, you may want to run the release
process _locally_.

=== Requirements

You must have write permissions to the https://github.com/kiali/kiali[kiali public GitHub repository] in
order to be able to push the tags. You will also need an DockerHub account that
is able to publish to the
https://hub.docker.com/r/kiali/kiali/[DockerHub kiali/kiali repository].

You will need a working dev environment (git, golang, docker, make, etc).
You will also need the following tools available in your $PATH:

* https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool[semver] shell utility - used
  to update version numbers
* https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] - to download and package kiali-ui
* curl - because the release process places PRs using the GitHub API

If the release process can't update the kiali repositories,
a PR is automatically created if you provide a GitHub Token for your account.

It's assumed that you are running the release process in you fork of the
https://github.com/kiali/kiali[kiali/kiali GitHub repository].

=== Making the release

. Make a release of the front-end, if needed
** Please, follow the https://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui/blob/master/RELEASING.adoc[releasing guide for the front-end]
** You can omit this step if there is no need to release the front-end. Kiali
   will be released using the specified version of the front-end.
. Login to DockerHub
** `docker login docker.io`
. Checkout the code that you want to release:
** `git checkout branch_to_release` (usually, you should release "master")
** Be advised that the release process will commit changes locally.
** PATCH RELEASES: you need to check out the minor branch (vX.Y) and cherry-pick all commits that need to go into the patch release. You should then push these new commits to the vX.Y branch. At this point, you can continue the release build.
. The release process may need to create a PR to prepare the code for the next
  version. A GitHub token is required to create the PR:
** `export GH_TOKEN={your_github_token}`
** Optional: If a token is not provided, a branch is created in your
   fork of the code, if needed. Then, you can place the PR manually.
. Run the release process:
** `CONSOLE_VERSION="{ui-version}" make -f deploy/jenkins-ci/Makefile release`

In the last step, you can omit the CONSOLE_VERSION variable. However, it is
_**very** highly_ recommended that you specify the version of the UI to package.
If you released kiali-ui (step 1), you should specify the version you just released.
Else, you should specify whatever version you need packaged. If you don't specify
a kiali-ui version, the console version specified in the main `Makefile`
will be downloaded from NPM and packaged in the release. If the main `Makefile`
specifies `latest` as the console version, the latest version *published* in NPM
will be used, which is not necessarily the latest _released_ version
(most likely it will be a snapshot).

By default, it's assumed that you are doing a _minor_ release.
If want to do another type of release, you can run the release process specifying
the RELEASE_TYPE variable. Valid values are "major", "minor", "patch", "edge" and
"snapshot._X_". For example:

* `RELEASE_TYPE="snapshot.1" make -f deploy/jenkins-ci/Makefile release`

*Note*: The process will adjust the version string as needed, according to
the type of release. Please, don't try to adjust the version string (i.e.
don't change the version in the `Makefile`).

=== Available options

* The generated Docker image is published to kiali/kiali DockerHub repository.
  If you want to publish to another repository:
** `DOCKER_NAME="{repository}" make -f deploy/jenkins-ci/Makefile release``
* In _major_, _minor_ or _patch_ mode, the release process updates or creates
  a version branch in the kiali-ui repository (the branch name is like
  "vMAJOR.MINOR"). You can omit the creation of this branch:
** `OMIT_VERSION_BRANCH=y make -f deploy/jenkins-ci/Makefile release`
* In _major_, _minor_ or _patch_ mode, the release
  process may create a branch in your fork of the repository with
  the required changes to prepare the code for the next release. The branch is
  created if it isn't possible to push to the kiali-ui repository. By default,
  the name of the branch is _prepare_next_version_. If you want to customize the
  name of the branch:
** `BUMP_BRANCH_ID={branch_name} make -f deploy/jenkins-ci/Makefile release`
